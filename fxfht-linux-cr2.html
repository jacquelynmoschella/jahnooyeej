I've also done software upgrades, including kernel and a the newest version of QEMU (I was using old qemu-saren-git from AUR since it had some patches I wanted). After that, and honestly I don't know how much after that because I've been trying to fix this myself for a long time, the guest started experiencing freezes.

Thanks everyone for the congrats, I'm just excited that we can continue on! Here is what I did. I took the first 5 lines of each of the KP screens in order. I then moved in 9 characters including any white space. This was a bit trial and error because I had to get the indentation just right based on the screenshots.

Hi all! Please advice me something instead of amazon cloud drive. As you know, they changed a tariff :( And now they tells me, they will delete my files after several of months :( I'm looking for something similar which has Linux support(amazon cloud disk officially does not have Linux support, but it is opensource tool acd_cli). The biggest part of my files which have to be archived are the photos (CR2 raw images). So, maybe I'll use Amazon S3 or Amazon Glacier. I don't know, maybe community. Доброе время суток, форумчане!

I'm messing around with a basic kernel module and I'm not sure why the below use of __initdata causes a crash on rmmod.
